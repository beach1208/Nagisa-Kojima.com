My design steps.

### 1.Research and Planning. - Who are target users?

- Get attention of users by developing beautiful and user friendly interface.

### 3. Wireframing

- I like to use a software either Adobe XD or Sketch for wireframing.

### 4. Design

- Pay attention to Font-family, Font-size, colors and shapes.
- In this website, I designed a logo by using illustrator.

### 5. Design Review

- Modify my design depending on feedback.

## Development

### SASS & Gulp

I used SASS as a CSS processor and Gulp as a task runner. It helped me a lot to code stylesheet much faster and I easily could make reuseable variables and Mixins.

### Scrollify.js
I picked Scrollify.js for making smooth full page scroll sections. It's implemented at Works page.

### GSAP
In a first phase of development, I added some animations to pages with CSS animation. It was good learnings and I loved it. However, GSAP is fast and easy to maintain my codes. In every page, I added some animations with GSAP.

### Wordpress
I developed this website as a static website at first. Then I learned about Wordpress. I divided all html files to php files for Wordpress theme development. 
It made the website dynamic and easily maintainable.

## The more things To Do
* Add animation with React.js or Vue.js instead of JQuery.
* Add Loading icons.
* Optimize SEO.
