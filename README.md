## Development

### SASS & Gulp

I used SASS as a CSS processor and Gulp as a task runner. It helped me a lot to code stylesheet much faster and I easily could make reuseable variables and Mixins.

### Scrollify.js
I picked Scrollify.js for making smooth full page scroll sections. It's implemented at Works page.

### GSAP
In a first phase of development, I used CSS animations to add motions in pages. In addition to it,I learned that GSAP was fast and easy to maintain my codes. So I added some animations with GSAP as well.

### Wordpress
I developed this website as a static website at first. Then I learned about Wordpress. I divided all html files to php files for Wordpress theme development. 
It made the website dynamic and easily maintainable.

## The more things To Do
* Add animation with React.js or Vue.js instead of JQuery.
* Add Loading icons.
* Optimize SEO.
